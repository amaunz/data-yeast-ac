Created two activity-files:
A structure was classified as active, if
- at least one strain was >= 0.7 (ac_onestrain.class)
- all strains were >= 0.7 (ac_allstrains.class)

|-- ac.smi                             compounds in SMILES format
|-- ac_allstrains.active               sfgm compatible input format (actives)
|-- ac_allstrains.class                lazar and libfminer compatible input format (all)

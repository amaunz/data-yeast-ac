Created two activity-files:
A structure was classified as active, if
- at least one strain was >= 0.7 (ac_onestrain.class)
- all strains were >= 0.7 (ac_allstrains.class)

1) Remove numbers from ac.smi file to obtain 1 SMILES per row in file ac.no_nr.smi
2) do 'babel -d -ismi ac.no_nr.smi -osdf ac.sdf' to convert to MOL format
3) do 'perl sdf2gsp.pl < ac.sdf > ac.no_nr.gsp' to convert to gSpan input format
4) do 'ruby replace.rb ac.no_nr.gsp ac.smi > ac.f.gsp' to restore correct numbering from .smi file
[ optional: do 'ruby report.rb ac.f.gsp' to report trees without edges ]
5) do 'ruby remove.rb ac.f.gsp > ac.gsp' to remove trees without edges
[ optional: do 'ruby report.rb ac.gsp' to report trees without edges ]

Additionally, a few molecules have missing nodelabels. Those 8 molecules have to be removed manually:
mol_id   node_nr
84276    0
139615   3
270088   6
379436   5
621598   1
621599   1
634831   0
634835   0

b)
Alternatively, use ac_alt.smi, which has all the molecules mentioned unter a) removed.
